# 🚚 **GeoRouteIQ: Logistics Route Optimizer with Real-Time Traffic Heatmaps**

![Project Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-in--progress-yellow.svg)

**GeoRouteIQ** is a geospatial pipeline and web application that optimizes delivery routes across a city using OpenStreetMap road data, traffic conditions, and delivery clustering. Built to demonstrate real-world applications of geospatial infrastructure, this project highlights routing logic, spatial analytics, and cloud-native deployments.

---

## 🧭 Overview

In modern urban logistics, optimizing delivery routes is essential for reducing emissions, time, and cost. GeoRouteIQ leverages:
- 📦 Delivery clustering by spatial proximity
- 🛣️ Real-time traffic conditions
- 🔄 Route optimization via TSP
- 🗺️ Interactive map rendering

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Tools Used |
|-------|------------|
| Data Collection | OpenStreetMap, simulated delivery points, traffic APIs |
| Routing Engine | Python, NetworkX / OR-Tools |
| Spatial Storage | PostgreSQL + PostGIS |
| Visualization | Folium, Mapbox, or Kepler.gl |
| Automation | Bash, Python, GitHub Actions |
| Cloud Deployment | Docker, AWS EC2 / Lambda |
| Infrastructure as Code | Terraform |

## 💻 Features (Planned)

- [x] Simulate delivery point datasets  
- [ ] Generate optimized route from start to end using NetworkX / OR-Tools  
- [ ] Visualize route on interactive map (Folium/Mapbox)  
- [ ] Cluster delivery locations into optimal zones  
- [ ] Store spatial data in PostGIS  
- [ ] Enable dynamic routing with AWS Lambda  
- [ ] Deploy application via Docker on EC2  
- [ ] Automate infrastructure setup with Terraform

## 🔍 Example Use Case

> A local logistics company wants to minimize delivery time and fuel cost for 150+ stops across Austin, TX.  
GeoRouteIQ ingests those locations, clusters them into efficient zones, computes routes using current traffic data, and visualizes the optimized routes on a live map.
